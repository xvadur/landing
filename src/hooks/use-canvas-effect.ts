/**
 * @param ref     Ref to the `<canvas>` element.
 * @param setup   Runs once after the canvas is sized. Allocate state here and
 *                return a `(dt) => void` frame function. `dt` is ms since the
 *                previous frame.
 * @param options Sizing and pause behaviour. Pass a stable object (or omit) —
 *                it is read once per mount.
 *
 * `setup` is captured in a ref, so an inline arrow closing over the latest
 * props works without re-mounting the effect on every render. Read live prop
 * values through refs inside the frame function, matching how these effects
 * already track `speed` and `palette`.
 *
 * @example
 * useCanvasEffect(canvasRef, (ctx, el) => {
 *   let t = 0
 *   return (dt) => {
 *     t += dt * 0.001 * speedRef.current
 *     ctx.clearRect(0, 0, el.width, el.height)
 *   }
 * })
